# 1. Statistic - Probability
- Random Variable: is a variable whose possible numerical outcomes of a random phenomena, eg. toss the dice, x is value of face, x is RV
## a. DRV - Probability Density Function:
- DRV: X whose value in finite set x1, x2, ... , xn
-  Probability Density Function (PDF):
	- ![[Pasted image 20241019224625.png|500]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20241019225505.png|500]]
	- Condition:
	- ![[Pasted image 20241019224732.png|500]]
## b. Continuos Random Variable (CRV):
- Value space is R or subset of R
- Probability Density Function: f(x) is PDF of a CRV X if:

## c. Cumulative Probability Distribution:
- Consider a random variable X, its cumulative probability function F(x) is defined as follows:

# 2. Typical Data Distributions
## a. Uniform Distribution
- P(X) = 1 / total number of possible outcomes
